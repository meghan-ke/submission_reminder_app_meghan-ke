# submission_reminder_app
This is a submission remidner app that prompts the user most preferably an educator or a Head of Project at a certain company whether or not a certain work or project has been submitted on time.
In this case we created one script that creates the necessary directory structure known as create_environment.sh.
.
├── app
│   └── reminder.sh
├── assets
│   └── submissions.txt
├── config
│   └── config.env
├── modules
│   └── functions.sh
└── startup.sh

. We also have a copilot_shell_script.sh that prompts the user to update to a new assignment in order for the application to successful and perform what was intended to. 
. The startup.sh is like the heart of the program. Whithin this script the whole application is able to work and all the codes are able to run and perform their functions. So in this case if the app is running properly it will display the number of students that have not yet submitted according to the deadline.
